## Obsidian Parent Auto Tag

Provides auto-tagging of markdown files within an Obsidian vault with each of the
file's parent directory names, so that the directory structure shows up as nodes
in the graph view.

Personally, I enjoy a nested folder structure for organising my notes, however
Obsidian is certainly geared more towards place-anywhere notes with a rich tagging
and linking mechanism to relate and categorize. This provides the best of both worlds - leveraging
the tagging system autonomously while using nest file structures as the primary means
of categorisation.

Work in progress, primarily for personal use at the moment.

### This WILL make changes to your files if you install it - at present the code is executed as soon as the plugin is enabled!!!
